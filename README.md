This is a digital modulation coding exercise to be preferrably octave where a specific sigal is declared and modulated using a for loop. once modulation is complete, we plot and display modualated digital signal along with its carrier signal using the subplot function 
There are different types of modulation and here BFSK, BPSK and ASK digital modulation
